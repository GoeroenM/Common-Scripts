# Common-Scripts
Contains useful functions used for data manipulation

These repositories contain a bunch of useful functions that I have written or have created using similar functions that can help in various data manipulation processes. I created a repo for both R and Python scripts.
Since I work with both languages, I try to translate any function I write in one to the other and keep both repos updated.
